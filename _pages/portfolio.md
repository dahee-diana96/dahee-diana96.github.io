I'm currently a job seeker in Data field. 
Professionally, I have worked as an AI Researcher and a Product Manager specializing in AI-driven services, focusing on user research and iterative product development.

During my B.S., I was also selected for the "Data Mine Living-Learning Community", where I lived and studied with peers and faculty, gaining hands-on experience in data mining and fostering meaningful academic and personal connections.
